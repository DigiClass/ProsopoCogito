Welcome to Recogito

This is just a dummy text document to get you started. Create annotations
by selecting text with your mouse. We have already created an example commentary
annotation for you here. Click on it to open it.

Try tagging a word as a place. Recogito will automatically provide a suggestion
for your selection (which you can confirm or change manually). For example,
select the word Vienna, and click the "Place" category button in the editor popup.

Ready to go? Upload your own text documents by clicking the blue 'New Document'
button on your personal start page.
