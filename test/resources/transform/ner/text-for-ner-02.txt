And Jove said, "My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget Ulysses than whom
there is no more capable man on earth, nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal 
gods that live in heaven? Bear in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with 
Ulysses for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son 
to Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter to the sea-king Phorcys; therefore though he will 
not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by preventing him from getting home. Still, 
let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then be
pacified, for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us."
