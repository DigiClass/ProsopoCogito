    This quick tutorial will give you an overview of Recogito's most important features.
    <strong>You will learn how to:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upload texts and images</li>
    <li>Create annotations</li>
    <li>Identify and map places in your documents</li>
    <li>Export your data in order to re-use it outside of Recogito</li>
    <li>Invite other users to work with you</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="what">What is Recogito?</h2>

  <p>
    Recogito is an online platform for collaborative document annotation. It is
    maintained by <a href="http://commons.pelagios.org" target="_blank">Pelagios Commons</a>,
    a Digital Humanities initiative aiming to foster better linkages between online
    resources documenting the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recogito provides a personal workspace where you can upload, collect and organize
    your source materials - texts and images <!-- and tabular data-->- and collaborate in their
    annotation and interpretation. Recogito enables you to make your work
    visible on the Web more easily, and to expose the results of your research
    as Open Data.
  </p>

  <p>
    This tutorial will teach you the essentials of working with Recogito. To complete the
    tutorial, you need a <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org/signup" target="_blank">Recogito
    account</a>, and two sample documents: a plain .txt file with some text, and an image file.
  </p>

  <p class="tip">
    Tip: Open this tutorial in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it
    while you complete the steps.
  </p>

  <h2 id="upload">Step 1. Upload a Document</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Documents</strong> are used to organize your materials in Recogito. Each document
    can consist of multiple files. But for now, we are just going to upload a document
    consisting of a single text file.
  </p>

  <p>
    <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/new-document.png")">
  </p>

  <p>
    Click <strong>New Document</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>To upload a new text document</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Enter a title for your document and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>Upload your text file. You can either click <strong>Choose a File to Attach</strong>
      and select it in the file browser, or you can drag it into the upload area with your
      mouse.</li>
    <li>Recogito can run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition" target="_blank">Named
      Entity Recognition (NER)</a> on your text. This will attempt to identify and pre-annotate places
      and persons automatically. Check <strong>Apply automatic annotation</strong> and click
      <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Depending on the length of your text, NER may take a while (up to several minutes). Once
    completed, click <strong>Done</strong>. Congratulations! You have imported your first document
    into your workspace.
  </p>

  <h3>To upload a new image document</h3>
  <p>
    Repeat the steps above to create another document from your image file. In the last upload
    step, Recogito may take few seconds to convert your image into a <strong>zoomable
    image</strong>. But more on that later.
  </p>

  <h2 id="annotations">Step 2. Create Annotations</h2>
  <p>
    Open your text document by double-clicking it in the list. This will take you to the
    <strong>annotation view</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>To create a text annotation</h3>
  <p>
    Select text like you would in any word processing tool: either by clicking and
    dragging with your mouse, or by double clicking a word. You can add text
    comments and tags, as well as identify the selected text as a
    <strong>Place</strong>, <strong>Person</strong> or <strong>Event</strong>. (We will learn
    more about how to deal with places in a minute.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/annotation-view.png")">
  </p>

  <p>
    Try experimenting with the annotation tool. You can edit or delete each part of an
    annotation seperately, after you have created it. (To delete a tag, click on it first
    to get a delete button.) Deleting all parts of an annotation will also remove the highlight
    from the text.
  </p>

  <h3>To create an image annotation</h3>
  <p>
    Open your image document. Recogito provides a <strong>zoomable view</strong> that enables you
    navigate even the highest-resolution images quickly and easily.


    In the toolbar, there is a drop-down menu where you can switch
    between Recogito's different selection modes: <strong>Point</strong>,
    <strong>Rectangle</strong> and <strong>Tilted Box</strong>.
