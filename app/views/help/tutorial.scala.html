    This quick tutorial will give you an overview of Recogito's most important features.
    <strong>You will learn how to:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upload texts and images</li>
    <li>Create annotations</li>
    <li>Identify and map places in your documents</li>
    <li>Invite other users to work with you</li>
    <li>Download and re-use your data outside of Recogito</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="what">What is Recogito?</h2>

  <p>
    Recogito is an online platform for collaborative document annotation. It is
    maintained by <a href="http://commons.pelagios.org" target="_blank">Pelagios Commons</a>,
    a Digital Humanities initiative aiming to foster better linkages between online
    resources documenting the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recogito provides a personal workspace where you can upload, collect and organize
    your source materials - texts, images and data tables - and collaborate in their
    annotation and interpretation. With Recogito, you can also make your work
    visible to the public easily, and make the data resulting from your research available
    as Open Data.
  </p>

  <p>
    This tutorial will teach you the essentials of working with Recogito. To complete it,
    you need a <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org/signup" target="_blank">Recogito
    account</a>, and two sample documents: a plain .txt file with some text, and an image file.
  </p>

  <p class="tip">
    Tip: Open this tutorial in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it
    while you complete the steps.
  </p>

  <h2 id="upload">Step 1. Upload a Document</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Documents</strong> are used to organize your materials in Recogito. Each document
    can consist of multiple files. But for now, we are just going to upload a document
    consisting of a single text file.
  </p>

  <p>
    <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/new-document.png")">
  </p>

  <p>
    Click <strong>New Document</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>To upload a new text document</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Enter a title for your document and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>Upload your text file. You can either click <strong>Choose a File to Attach</strong>
      and select it in the file browser, or you can drag it into the upload area with your
      mouse.</li>
    <li>Recogito can run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition" target="_blank">Named
      Entity Recognition (NER)</a> on your text. This will attempt to identify and pre-annotate places
      and persons automatically. Check <strong>Apply automatic annotation</strong> and click
      <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Depending on the length of your text, NER may take a while (up to several minutes). Once
    completed, click <strong>Done</strong>. Congratulations - you will now find your document
    listed in your workspace.
  </p>

  <h3>To upload a new image document</h3>
  <p>
    Repeat the steps above to create another document from your image file. In the last upload
    step, Recogito may take few seconds to convert your image into a <strong>zoomable
    image</strong>. But more on that later.
  </p>

  <h2 id="annotations">Step 2. Create Annotations</h2>
  <p>
    Open a document by double-clicking it in the list. This will take you to the
    <strong>annotation view</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>To create a text annotation</h3>
  <p>
    Select text like you would in any word processing tool: either by slicking and
    dragging with your mouse, or by double clicking a word. You can add text
    comments and tags, as well as identify the selected text as a
    <strong>Place</strong>, <strong>Person</strong> or <strong>Event</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/help/annotation-view.png")">
  </p>

  <p>
    Try experimenting with this feature. You can edit or delete each part of an annotation
    after you have created it. (To delete a tag, click on it first to get a delete button.)
  </p>

  <h3>To create an image annotation</h3>
