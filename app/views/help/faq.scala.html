  <h2 id="supported-formats">What kind of documents can I upload?</h2>
  <p>Presently, Recogito supports:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>UTF-8 plaintext files</li>
    <li>Images in JPEG, TIFF and PNG format</li>
    <li>Images served via <a href="http://iiif.io" target="_blank">IIIF</a> (currently,
      single images only but no collection manifests)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="user-quota">Can I upload unlimited documents?</h2>
  <p>
    There is no fixed limit to the number of documents you upload. However, standard private work
    spaces are limited to a total size of 200 MB. Please get in touch with us if you require additional
    space.
  </p>

  <h2 id="legal">Are there legal considerations to using Recogito?</h2>
  <p>
    UK Copyright Law permits the use of third party material for &quot;private and research study
    purposes&quot;. (Please check copyright or similar laws for your own country!) Uploaded
    documents are hosted in your private area, and will be accessible only to you - unless you
    choose to share them with other users. If you have verified that the document is not under
    copyright, you can make it publicly available by ticking the &quot;Visible to all&quot; option
    in your document sharing options. (Please also refer to our <a href="/signup">Terms and
    Conditions</a> for additional information.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Copyright is an automatic right. But other licensing arrangements may also apply and you must
    take legal responsibility for adhering to all of them. In particular, be aware that some
    &quot;open&quot; Creative Commons licenses have a &quot;No Derivatives&quot; clause which
    according to most copyright laws includes annotations. You must not make such works public
    within Recogito without prior consent from the copyright owner.
  </p>

  <h2 id="concurrent-editing">Can I work with other people at the same time?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, you can work concurrently on the same document with other people. But at present
    you will not be able to see other people's edits in real-time. Changes made by others
    will only be visible after you refresh the page.
  </p>

  <h2 id="what-is-a-gazetteer">What is a gazetteer?</h2>
  <p>To paraphrase from the introductory chapters of
    <a href="http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=808056" target="_blank">Berman,
    Mostern &amp; Southall, Placing Names: Enriching and Integrating Gazetteers</a>: Most simply,
    a gazetteer is a list of places. A <em>digital gazetteer</em>, in particular, will often include
    names, coordinates and sometimes feature types for each place. Today, gazetteers are
    the basis for much of the spatial search and visualization we all have come to take for
    granted on the Web.
  </p>

  <h2 id="available-gazetteers">Which gazetteers are currently available in Recogito?</h2>
  <p>The following gazetteers are currently available</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org" target="_blank">Pleiades Gazetteer of the Ancient World</a></li>
    <li>Places published by the <a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/" target="_blank">Digital Atlas of the
      Roman Empire (DARE)</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.geonames.org" target="_blank">GeoNames</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="which-gazetteer">How do I know which gazetteer to use?</h2>
  <p>
    Different gazetteers will often provide overlapping, but also complementary (and sometimes even
    conflicting) information about places for particular time periods or regions. We recommend that
    you select the gazetteer you feel best reflects the document that you are working on (e.g.
    <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org" target="_blank">Pleiades</a> or
    <a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/" target="_blank">DARE</a> for Ancient history,
    <a href="http://www.geonames.org" target="_blank">GeoNames</a> for contemporary material) and
    aim to stay consistent as much as possible throughout the document.
  </p>
  <p>
    We aim to add further gazetteers to Recogito over time. In addition, we are working actively
    with the gazetteer community to assist in the <em>alignment</em> of gazetteers - which means
    that place references you associate with one gazetteer will automatically become associated with
    relevant places in other gazetteers in Recogito.
  </p>

  <h2 id="what-is-linked-data">What is Linked Data and how does Recogito use it?</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data" target="_blank">Linked Data</a> is a way of
    connecting online resources that have some element in common. In our case, that common element
    is <em>Place</em>: Recogito connects places referenced in documents to online gazetteers and
    makes annotations available to you in a Linked Data format called the
    <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/" target="_blank">Open Annotation Data Model</a>.
    Linked Data is also the method that is used under the hood of Recogito to align different
    gazetteers with each other (see <a href="#which-gazetteer">above</a>).
  </p>

  <h2 id="roadmap">What's on the roadmap for the future of Recogito?</h2>
  <p>
    Some immediate things we are currently working on include: adding support for TEI/XML-encoded
    texts, data tables in CSV format, and enabling import for IIIF collection manifests.
  </p>

  <h2 id="citing-recogito">How can I cite Recogito in a bibliography?</h2>
  <p>Please list our URL and the month and year you accessed it, as in the following example:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Recogito, an initiative of Pelagios Commons:
    <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org/">http://recogito.pelagios.org/</a> (accessed 12 September 2016)
