  <h2 id="supported-formats">What kind of documents can I upload?</h2>
  <p>Presently, Recogito supports:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>UTF-8 plaintext files</li>
    <li>Images in JPEG, TIFF and PNG format</li>
    <li>Images served via <a href="http://iiif.io" target="_blank">IIIF</a> (currently, single images only)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We are working towards support for TEI/XML-encoded texts, data tables in CSV format, and support for
    IIIF collection manifests.
  </p>

  <h2 id="user-quota">Can I upload unlimited documents?</h2>
  <p>
    No. The standard private work spaces have an upload limit of 200 MB. Please get in touch
    with us if you require additional space.
  </p>

  <h2 id="legal">Are there legal considerations to using Recogito?</h2>
  <p>
    UK Copyright Law permits the use of third party material for &quot;private and research study
    purposes&quot;. Uploaded documents are hosted in your private area, and will be accessible only
    to you - unless you choose to share them with other users. You can make documents publicly
    available by ticking the &quot;Visible to all&quot; option in your document sharing options.
    But may strictly only do so in circumstances where the document is not under copyright. (Please
    also refer to our <a href="/signup">Terms and Conditions</a>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Copyright is an automatic right. But other licensing arrangements may also apply and you must
    take legal responsibility for adhering to them. In particular, be aware that some &quot;open&quot;
    Creative Commons licenses have a &quot;No Derivatives&quot; clause which according to most
    copyright laws includes annotations. You may not make such works public within Recogito without
    prior consent from the copyright owner.
  </p>

  <h2 id="concurrent-editing">Can I work on the same document with other people at the same time?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, you can work concurrently on the same document. But at present you will not be able
    to see other people's edits in real-time like, say, in Google Drive.
  </p>

  <h2 id="what-is-a-gazetteer">What is a gazetteer?</h2>
  <p>To paraphrase from the introductory chapters of
    <a href="http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=808056" target="_blank">Berman,
    Mostern &amp; Southall, Placing Names: Enriching and Integrating Gazetteers</a>: Most simply,
    a gazetteer is a list of places. A <em>digital gazetteer</em>, in particular, will often include
    names, coordinates and sometimes features types for each place as well. Today, gazetteers are
    the basis for much of the spatial search and visualization we all have come to take for
    granted on the Web.
  </p>

  <h2 id="available-gazetteers">Which gazetteers are currently available in Recogito?</h2>
  <p>The following gazetteers are currently available</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org" target="_blank">Pleiades Gazetteer of the Ancient World</a></li>
    <li>Places from the <a href="http://dare.ht.lu.se/" target="_blank">Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.geonames.org" target="_blank">GeoNames</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="which-gazetteer">How do I know which gazetteer to use?</h2>
  <p>
    Different gazetteers will provide different, often complementary (and sometimes even conflicting),
    information about places for particular time periods or regions. We recommend that you select
    the gazetteer you feel best reflects the document that you are working on, e.g.
    <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org" target="_blank">Pleiades</a> for Ancient history,
    <a href="http://www.geonames.org" target="_blank">GeoNames</a> for contemporary material.
  </p>
  <p>
    We aim to add further gazetteers to Recogito over time. In additiona, we are working actively
    with the gazetteer community to assist in the <em>alignment</em> of gazetteers - which means
    that place references you associate with one gazetteer will automatically become associated with
    relevant places in other gazetteers as well.
  </p>

  <h2 id="what-is-linked-data">What is Linked Data and how does Recogito use it?</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data" target="_blank">Linked Data</a> is a way of
    connecting online resources that have some element in common. In our case, that common element
    is <em>Place</em>: Recogito connects documents to online gazetteers and makes annotations
    available to you in a Linked Data format called the
    <a href="http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/" target="_blank">Open Annotation Data Model</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 id="citing-recogito">How can I cite Recogito in a bibliography?</h2>
  <p>Please list our URL and the month and year you accessed it, as in the following example:</p>

  <blockquote>
    Recogito, an initiative of Pelagios Commons:
    <a href="http://recogito.pelagios.org/">http://recogito.pelagios.org/</a> (accessed 12 September 2016)
